Lab Extension
=============

JupyterCAD comes with a JupyterLab extension that embeds CAD features directly into the JupyterLab UI.
This extension allows you to:

* Open ``.FCstd`` and ``.jcad``` files in JupyterLab
* Create new ``.jcad`` files
* Edit those files by creating new primitives and applying boolean operators
